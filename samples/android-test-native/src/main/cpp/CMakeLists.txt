# Creates and names a library, sets it as either STATIC
# or SHARED, and provides the relative paths to its source code.
# You can define multiple libraries, and CMake builds them for you.
# Gradle automatically packages shared libraries with your APK.

add_library( # Sets the name of the library.
        native-lib
        # Sets the library as a shared library.
        SHARED
        # Provides a relative path to your source file(s).

# Searches for a specified prebuilt library and stores the path as a
# variable. Because CMake includes system libraries in the search path by
# default, you only need to specify the name of the public NDK library
# you want to add. CMake verifies that the library exists before
# completing its build.

## Testing: load agent-ndk as a submodule
# add_subdirectory(agent-ndk)
# target_include_directories(agent-ndk-a PUBLIC agent-ndk)
# target_include_directories(agent-ndk-a PUBLIC agent-ndk/include)
# target_link_libraries(
#         native-lib
#         PUBLIC agent-ndk-a
