Android Native Agent MVP


The New Relic Android native reporting agent is a light-weight module to observe and report runtime error conditions. 

It currently reports abnormal termination from signals, unhandled C++ exceptions, and 'Application Not Responding' (ANR) conditions


## Native Crashes
What violations are of concern to an Android app?

SIGILL	Illegal instruction: Attempt is made to execute an invalid, privileged, or ill-formed instruction
SIGABRT Abnormal termination: often called by C library 'exit()' or 'abort()' functions
SIGFPE	Floating-point exception: covers all arithmetic errors, including division by zero and overflow
SIGBUS	Bus error:  bad memory access, such as a null pointer exception
SIGSEGV	Segmentation violation: invalid memory reference

The default action for all of these signals is to terminate the process.


## Unhandled C++ Exceptions

## Application Not Responding' (ANR) conditions


What is the current state of the agent?

How is the agent integrated into an existing app?

As custom with Android apps, the agent is added as a dependency to the app's build.gradle file: 

dependencies {
	implementation "com.newrelic.agent.android:agent-ndk:1.0.+‚Äù
}

The agent uses a simple builder pattern, can be started, stopped by the caller as needed

What is the format of delivered reports?
	JSON - describe schema

	How does is compare to Google native crash/ANR reporting?

Are crashing stack frames fully symbolicated?
