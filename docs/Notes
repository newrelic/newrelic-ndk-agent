Required for targetSdkLevel 30 and above: You must disable Pointer Tagging in your app by
adding the following to your AndroidManifest.xml:
    <application android:allowNativeHeapPointerTagging="false">
    ...
    </application>

Both the Crashlytics SDK for NDK and the Crashlytics Gradle plugin depend on the presence of the
GNU build ID within the native shared objects.

You can verify the presence of this ID by running readelf -n on each binary. If the build ID
is absent, add -Wl,--build-id to your build system's flags to fix the problem.

# Symbols

AGP will strip symbols for the APK by default, but you can override it with
    packagingOptions {
        doNotStrip {
            "libs/*/libfoo.so"
        }
    }
